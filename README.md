# VBA_Challenge

## Overview of Project
   The Purpose of this analysis is to assist a friend who just graduated with a finance degree in creating a spreadsheet to compare the pros and cons to many different green stock options. His parents are looking to invest, and he wishes to help them diversify their profile. This project in particular looks at automating a worksheet to work with the data set it has been given. As well as offering a refraction on our original code, allowing for it to work through data sets even faster than before.
## Results
    The stocks themselves appear to have performed significantly worse in the year 2018 than they did in 2017, with all but TERP seeing increased returns in 2017 while only ENPH and RUN had positive returns in 2018. The runtimes have significantly decreased, from an average of 0.83 seconds with my original code, to right around a tenth of a second.
## Summary
    In general there needs to be a pro and con debate to your code refractoring. While, on one hand, it allows the program to run more efficiently, is it really worth spending hours perfecting the code to save, maybe, half a second in runtime? It, obviously, makes things run smoother for the front end user, and in a scenario where many many people will be referencing the code multiple times that will help, however in a situation like this it may not be completely worth the additional effort.
